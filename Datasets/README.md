# This file should be in this format:

Datasets/

── train_hr/

── train_x2_bic/

── train_x2_unk/

── train_x3_bic/

── train_x3_unk/

── train_x4_bic/

── train_x4_unk/

── val_hr/

── val_x2_bic/

── val_x2_unk/

── val_x3_bic/

── val_x3_unk/

── val_x4_bic/

── val_x4_unk/

### You can directly run the python file by:
```
python creat_datasets_file.py
```

### Then you will get the folder structure and you need to put the datasets to corresponding folders.
(eg. put high-resolution train dataset to train_hr folder.)
